# About This Website

This website demonstrates a more advanced Jamstack app that includes protected routes and dynamically loaded content.

This site is deployed to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) using a GitHub repo for automatic deployments.

For more information, [check out the workshop](https://jason.af/workshop/jamstack-fast-track) where we built this example.
